ScrollsPCH
==========

ScrollsPC Helper is a mod for the game Scrolls which allows users to check Scroll prices ingame

To use, just use the command /pc, /price or /pricecheck in the ingame chat.
Its syntax is /pc <name>. <name> is the scroll's name. So if you want to get the price for Violent Dispersal, you type: /pc Violent Dispersal

You can just type /pc dispersal, though, because it is the only scroll with the word 'dispersal' in it. So you can shorten your queries.
