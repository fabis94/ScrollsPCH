ScrollsPCH
==========

ScrollsPC Helper is a mod for the game Scrolls which allows users to check Scroll prices ingame. Prices are taken from ScrollsPC.com, the scrolls price database that gets updated by the whole community.
With version 2, prices are going to be updated even quicker, because this mod sends anonymous trading data to our servers, so whenever you trade, that gets anonymously logged on our servers (we don't save your username so we can't identify you) and we see for what prices are people trading scrolls.

To use, just use the command /pc, /price or /pricecheck in the ingame chat.
Its syntax is /pc <name>. <name> is the scroll's name. So if you want to get the price for Violent Dispersal, you type: /pc Violent Dispersal

You can also use /lpc <scroll> which will return the Live Price for the item (the price taken from trades).

You can just type /pc dispersal, though, because it is the only scroll with the word 'dispersal' in it. So you can shorten your queries.
